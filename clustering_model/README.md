Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
