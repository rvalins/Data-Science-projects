**Convolutional neural network**

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

This project includes a code that allows users to create a dataset from a collection of images and to prepare Train and Test files to the model.

1. Train Test Spilt (Scikit-Learn)
2. Training the model
3. Evaluation of the model
