### Machine	Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow 

- [Emotion and identity detection from face images](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/tree/master/emotion-identity-detection)

Convolutional neural network
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

This project includes a code that allows users to create a dataset from a collection of images and to prepare Train and Test files to the model.

- [Machine Learning on the Iris dataset (classification model)](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/classification-models/classification_model.ipynb)
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

Algorithms:
K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic regression

### Using Python to performance Data Manipulation or to automate tasks

- [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/elasticsearch/ElasticSearch_connection.ipynb)
This project allows users to connect to a ElasticSearch server, to extract and to write this data in a JSON file.
Elasticsearch is a full-text, distributed NoSQL database.
This code also record the previous indexes that were scanned to only get new inputs.
You can use the JSON to CSV file to convert to a structered table format.

- [Convert JSON to CSV file](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/json_to_csv/json_to_csv-file.ipynb)
This project reads a JSON file, parse it and convert it to a CSV file.


- [Using Python to send Emails from Gmail](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/send_email/send_email.ipynb)
This project aggregate several features, such as:
1. To custom email sender address
As your email address is more likely to be to be recognized by your applicants and reviewers, your email is more likely to be received and not get caught in spam filters.

2. To custom subject field
You will be able to set up an interactive subject field

3. To define recipients according to a mailing list (CSV file)
This project extract information from a mailing list, grouping recipients according to their company (for example)

4. To define language content
Possibility to send different contents according to the language informed at mailing list

5. To use HTML format in your message
This project allows you to import a HTML content and send it, according to the language selected

6. To use attachments
This project allows you to send more than one attachment, no matter the filetype and addressed correctly to the recipients group

7. To keep register of the use
This project create a log register for further reference


- [Data Analytics with Python by Web scraping](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/webscraping/WebScraping.ipynb)
This project allows you to extract information from one website, using Python (BeautifulSoup).
BeautifulSoup is a Python library which helps you to navigate, search and modify the parse tree.
This information will be presented in a word cloud visualization.
