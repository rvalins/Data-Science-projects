### [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/elasticsearch)
This project allows users to connect to a ElasticSearch server, to extract and to write this data in a JSON file.

Elasticsearch is a full-text, distributed NoSQL database.

This code also record the previous indexes that were scanned to only get new inputs.

You can use the JSON to CSV file to convert to a structered table format.
