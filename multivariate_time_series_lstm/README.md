### [Multivariate Time Series Forecasting - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://github.com/rvalins/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/multivariate_time_series_lstm)
Multivariate time series analysis considers simultaneously more than one time-dependent variable. Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has some dependency on other variables.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks are able to almost seamlessly model problems with multiple input variables.
